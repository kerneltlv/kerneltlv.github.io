Hi guys, we look forward to seeing you at the next meetup on 8.5 at 19:00 in
the large conference room at Google Campus TLV.

Gil Yankovitch will discuss the PaX patch for the Linux kernel, focusing on
memory manager changes and security mechanisms for memory allocations, reads,
writes from user/kernel space and ASLR.

Ido Ben-Yair will talk about the purpose and implementation of anonymous
shared memory in Android and how we can leverage it for interesting effects.

Schedule:  
19:00-19:15 Mingling time  
19:15-20:15 PaX (and Q&amp;A)  
20:15-20:25 Break  
20:25-21:15 ashmem (and Q&amp;A)

The talks will be given in Hebrew.

We're always looking for more speakers. If you're interested in giving a talk,
feel free to contact us.
