**Locking mechanisms in the kernel**

In this lecture we will present various locking mechanisms implemented in the
linux kernel.  
From sysV locks to raw spinlocks and locks under the RT patch.

  
**Lecturer**: Mark Veltzer - CTO of Hinbit and a senior instructor at John Bryce. Mark is also a member of the Free Source Foundation and contributes to many free projects.

**High performance storage devices in kernel.**

In this lecture we will present the Linux Kernel storage layers and dive into
blk-mq, a scalable parallel block layerfor high performance block devices, and
how it is used to unleash the performance of NVMe, flash and beyond.

  
**Lecturer**: Evgeny Budilovsky, Kernel Developer at E8 Storage
