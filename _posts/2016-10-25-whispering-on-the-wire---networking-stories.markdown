21:00-21:15 Q&amp;A

  
Ouri Lipner will share some of what he has stumbled upon in the realm of WiFi
in the kernel.

  
When not busy writing about himself in 3rd person, Ouri is a full time hacker
of both cyber and kernel varieties.

  
Ariel Waizel will discuss the Data Plane Development Kit (DPDK), an API for
developing fast packet processing code in userland.

  
* Who needs this library? Why bypass the kernel?  
* How does it work?  
* How good is it? What are the benchmarks?  
* Pros and cons  
* Bonus question (depending on time): How is DPDK integrated with vhost user, to gain high speed networking between processes?

  
Ariel worked on kernel development at the IDF, Ben Gurion University, and
several companies. He is interested in networking, security, machine learning,
and basically everything except UI. Currently a solution architect at
Contextream (an HPE company), which specialized in SDN solutions for the
telecom industry.

See you there,  
KTLV team.
