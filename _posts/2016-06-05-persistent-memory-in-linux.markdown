We are excited to invite you to yet another meetup. This time our guest host
is Benoit Hudzia from Ireland.

The talk will be given in English.

Meetup schedule:  
19:00-19:15 mingling  
19:15-20:00 Persistent memory Persistent memory holds a lot of promise: what's
not to like about vast amounts of directly-attached memory that remembers its
contents over a power cycle? For some years we have been told that large
persistent-memory arrays are coming; now it seems that they are about to
arrive. In this lecture we will be covering the following:

* What persistent memory is  
* The upcoming storage class memory (SCM) devices  
* Differences between NVMe and SCM  
* How to use it and emulate it  
* Challenges: durability and consistency  
* Remote access  
* Implications for next generation architectures
