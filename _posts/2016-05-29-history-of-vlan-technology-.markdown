PLEASE NOTE: space is limited this time. Please sign up because we won't have
space for everyone.

Elad Raz and Jiri Pirko will discuss the history and implementation of VLAN
technology in the Linux Kernel - how simple things can get quite complicated.

The talk will cover the VLAN implementation in the Linux Kernel and touch on
topics such as packet paths, offloading, user interfaces and alternative
implementations.

Please notice that the talk will be given in English this time.
