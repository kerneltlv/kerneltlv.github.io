The Linux kernel has a rich and modular cryptographic API that is used
extensively by familiar user facing software such as Android. It's also
cryptic, badly documented, subject to change and can easily bite you in
unexpected and painful ways.This talk will describe the crypto API, provide
some usage example and discuss some of the more interesting in-kernel users,
such as DM-Crypt, DM-Verity and the new fie system encryption code.

  
Speaker

  
Gilad Ben-Yossef is a principal software engineer at ARM. He works on the
kernel security sub-system and the ARM CryptCell engine. Open source work done
by Gilad includes an experiment in integration of network processors in the
networking stack, a patch set for reducing the interference caused to user
space processes in large multi-core systems by Linux kernel maintenance work
and on SMP support for the Synopsys Arc processor among others.  
Gilad has co-authored OReillys [Building Embedded Linux
Systems](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596529680.do) 2nd edition and
presented at such venues as Embedded Linux Conference Europe and the Ottawa
Linux Symposium, as well as co-founded Hamakor, an Israeli NGO for the
advancement for Open Source and Free Software in Israel. When not hacking on
kernel code you can find Gilad meditating and making dad jokes on Twitter.
