FreeBSD Drivers  
Have you ever heard of FreeBSD? Probably. Have you ever interacted with its
kernel? Probably not.  
In this talk, Gili Yankovitch (
[nyxsecuritysolutions.com](http://nyxsecuritysolutions.com/)) will talk about
the FreeBSD operating system, its network stack and how to write network
drivers for it.  
The talk will cover the following topics:

* Kernel/User interation in FreeBSD  
* The FreeBSD Network Stack  
* Network Buffers API  
* L2 and L3 Hooking

Our community is growing and we are always looking for speakers and venues to
accommodate our events.
