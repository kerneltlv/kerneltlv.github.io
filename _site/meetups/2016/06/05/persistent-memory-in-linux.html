<p>We are excited to invite you to yet another meetup. This time our guest host
is Benoit Hudzia from Ireland.</p>

<p>The talk will be given in English.</p>

<p>Meetup schedule:<br />
19:00-19:15 mingling<br />
19:15-20:00 Persistent memory Persistent memory holds a lot of promise: what’s
not to like about vast amounts of directly-attached memory that remembers its
contents over a power cycle? For some years we have been told that large
persistent-memory arrays are coming; now it seems that they are about to
arrive. In this lecture we will be covering the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>What persistent memory is</li>
  <li>The upcoming storage class memory (SCM) devices</li>
  <li>Differences between NVMe and SCM</li>
  <li>How to use it and emulate it</li>
  <li>Challenges: durability and consistency</li>
  <li>Remote access</li>
  <li>Implications for next generation architectures</li>
</ul>
