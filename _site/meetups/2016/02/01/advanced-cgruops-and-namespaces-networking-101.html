<p>Hello folks!<br />
It’s time for yet another great session with Rami Rosen.<br />
Rami is the author of “Linux Kernel Networking - Implementation and Theory” by
Appress, 2014). You should definitely checkout his website which is available
at the following link - <a href="http://ramirose.wix.com/ramirosen">http://ramirose.wix.com/ramirosen</a></p>

<p>This time our meetup is hosted by Checkpointat their office in Tel Aviv.<br />
The event will be held at a conference room on the ground floor (Pink
conference room).</p>

<p>The schedule for the event is:<br />
19:00-19:15 mingling time<br />
19:15-20:15 Advanced cgruops and namespaces (Lecture + Q&amp;A)<br />
20:15-20:25 break<br />
20:25-21:25 Introduction Linux Kernel Networking (Lecture + Q&amp;A)</p>

<p>Advanced cgruops and namespaces<br />
In this lecture we will continue from where we left off at the previous
cgroups and namespaces lecture and dive in even deeper!<br />
We will start with A short refresh about cgroups and namespaces. After that we
will look at a myriad set of brand new features of cgroups and namespaces:<br />
- cgroups v2 design (cgroup v2 was started to be merged in the current
kernel, 4.4)<br />
- cgroups v2 examples (migrating tasks, enabling and disabling controllers,
and more).<br />
- comparison between cgroup v2 unified hierarchy and cgroup v1 legacy
hierarchy.<br />
-PIDs namespaces (from kernel 4.3)<br />
cgroup namespaces (not merged yet)</p>

<p>Introduction Linux Kernel Networking<br />
In this talk we will discuss the packet traversal in the Linux kernel stack
(Rx/Tx) and its interaction with the various networking subsystems, with
emphasize on the routing subsystems (routing lookup, forwarding, multicast and
more).<br />
We will describe the main methods and the main data structures related to the
packet traversal both in Rx/Tx.</p>

<p>Notes:<br />
- The lectures will be filmed and the video will be uploaded to youtube
(subscribe to kerneltlv channel on youtube!)<br />
- The lectures will start at the specified hours so please don’t be late.<br />
- All the lectures will be in Hebrew.<br />
- It is recommended to go over the previous lecture that Rami gave on cgroups
and namespaces to make sure that you get the most out of the lecture.</p>

<p>P.S<br />
I’m always looking for new lectures so if you think you have what it takes and
want to give a lecture at when of our meetups just let me know :)</p>

<p>And as always I am waiting to see all of you guys. If I’m lucky maybe even see
a few new faces.</p>

<p>Cheers,<br />
Kfir.</p>
